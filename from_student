From a student (ClassOverflow)

 - A good test for coding is to use the same keyword multiple times (i.e. "text"), and make sure that people understand which "text"s are the same
 	- same variable names are really tricky

 - Documentation is really good

 - Kinds of questions I have: How do I implement this basic structure I can't describe?

 - Console log is really great for debugging or having a clue for what to do

 - Break hard problems into a lot of small steps, even if they're not completely functional

 - I'm getting really lucky with console testing "this"

 - It's easy to get mad or distracted on a problem you don't know how to visualize or tackle
