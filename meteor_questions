Why does Errors.find({}, {sort: {errorID: 1}}); work? Shouldn't sort be method or an operator?

Where does "this" come from? (How does javascript know what "this" is?)

How come in the template you call {{hintMsg}} instead of {{hint.hintMsg}}?
	Why do we quote these keys sometimes but not all the time?

How to work with query.find()? (toArray, next, etc. don’t work, but count() does)

Why can't I put javascript outside of the if(meteor.isClient)?

Why am I getting so many exceptions when the page loads? I’m guessing that it’s complaining about not having a Session.get(“currentUsername”) value. How can I work around this?

Why do I get internal server errors when I alert something in the follow/unfollow Meteor Methods?

OLD CODE

      /*var row = event.target;
      while (row.parentNode && row.tagName.toLowerCase()!="tr") {
        row = row.parentNode;
      }
      var errorDocs=Errors.find({"errorID": row.id});
      alert(errorDocs.next());

      if (errorDocs.count()==1) {
        var aoeu = errorDocs.toArray()[0];
        alert(aoeu);
        aoeu.hints.insert({
          hintMsg: hint,
          upvotes:0
        });
      }
      else {
        alert("Something went wrong!");
      }

      alert("aoeu");*/
